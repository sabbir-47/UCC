\section{Conclusion}

This section presents our auto-scaler architecture named \emph{GPaaScaler}, which continuously listens the instances of events \emph{e.g.,} response time, green energy availability, working modes of application etc., pushed by SaaS and IaaS in a changing environment. Furthermore, it inherits the capability to actuate both at application and at infrastructure level.
We use the most popular self-adaptive design framework: Monitor-Analyze-Plan-
Execute-Knowledge (MAPE-K) loop [16] for our auto-scaler.
Our contribution lies on the \emph{analyze} and \emph{plan} (A-P) block of this autonomic framework.
